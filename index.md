## Personal information

Currently I am a lecturer at [Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics at Harbin Institute of Technology](http://im.hit.edu.cn/). I completed my PhD thesis in [Laboratoire de Mathématiques Blaise Pascal (LMBP) at Université Clermont Auvergne](https://lmbp.uca.fr/) under the direction of Professors [Arnaud Guillin](https://lmbp.uca.fr/~guillin/) and [Liming Wu](https://lmbp.uca.fr/~wuliming/).  



## Research

My research interests are in kinetic theory and functional inequalities.
